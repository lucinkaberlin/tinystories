Thick fingers, grabbing his collar==================================



The only name he didn’t change was Mel. Mel, the school bully – she was the only character in his novel who was entirely drawn from life. Her fat cheeks, her streaked hair. Somehow no other name fitted. The novel was mildly successful, but he felt guilty: he heard that the real Mel lived on the estate near their old school, that her son was disabled and her husband had walked out. The novel seemed petty and inconsiderate – he wished he had written an imaginary bully – but he realised that in his own mind, all bullies were like Mel.
