Sleep singer
============
He used to sing in his sleep when he was little, and I’d go in and straighten the duvet, which usually quietened him down. He wanted to become an opera singer, and once fell out of bed whilst performing the aria from Turandot. After his voice broke, though, he didn’t sing anymore, and I’d stand in the corridor at night, waiting in vain for the concert to start.
