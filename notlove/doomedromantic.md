He had only had to drink a few bright green, strangely sweet cocktails to persuade himself that this was the one possible way to get her back.

And when the ex-army guy she had gone home with that night burst out from behind the door and hurled him to the floor, he felt the gritty carpet on his face and considered the possibility that there is sometimes a very fine line between a doomed romantic and a possessive idiot.
