The man who believed in himself===============================



Liebertanz considered himself an expert. Not just on tiled stoves, which he built for a living, but also on photography, jokes, women, and physics. When his house burned down due to a faultily repaired stove, he said, “Ah, that’s the laws of physics for you,” and his wife looked tired, and Liebertanz clapped her on the shoulder affectionately. “Come on, I’ll photograph you in front of the ruins. For the insurance!” he said. He never seemed to stop laughing at his own jokes, even long after the insurance company refused to pay out.
