Game Over=========



When she told people that Tim was getting married, they looked at her pityingly, and said carefully, 'You must be happy for him!' She was annoyed: she and Tim had been flatmates for years, and owned a cat together, as well as a record player, a tumble dryer and a pinball machine which they’d bought on a whim and hardly used, but none of this meant that she’d been secretly pining for him all this time. One night, she got home to find him hunched over the pinball machine, bright green messages telling him he had 500,000 bonus points. 'Every time I tell people I’m marrying Lisa, they ask me if you refused me,' he said, and she nodded. 'I know how you feel,' she told him, adding, 'do you think I could keep the tumble dryer?' She wasn’t sure, but she thought she saw a last spark of hope disappearing from his eyes.
