The man who talked constantly without ever telling his story
============================================================


He lived up in the hills on the edge of the Bohemian Forest, where he owned a bed and breakfast which did not make any money. He talked about his wife as if she were just about to come back. But all he had was a scrawny gingko biloba tree and a fridge full of beer that was past its sell-by date.
