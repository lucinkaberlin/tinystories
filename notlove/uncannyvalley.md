Uncanny valley==============



Alice read a novel about a woman who disappeared discreetly, having paid someone to keep her social networking profiles up and running, before gradually winding them down and breaking off contact with people. In the novel, it didnâ€™t turn out well, but the story still gave Alice ideas. She wondered if she could program a robot to take her place, answering her emails, while she disappeared into another world, but she found herself imagining the life of the robot all too vividly, until it occurred to her that she was the robot, and the real Alice had disappeared long ago.
