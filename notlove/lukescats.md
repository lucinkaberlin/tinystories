Luke’s cat’s least favourite person===================================


Luke had to admit that Rosa was not a good friend. She disappeared for months, not answering his calls; she was rude about his hairstyle behind his back; she put her feet on the sofa when she came round. But when she did appear, whisky in hand, and knocked over one of his matchstick models as she pushed her way into his living room, laughing at his new jumper and terrifying his cat, he was always delighted to see her.
