Slow train to the end
=====================
We reached the edge of the mountains, and I was the only passenger. I pressed the button before every stop, and stepped down briefly, breathed in the darkness and the hidden trees, before clambering up again. The conductor glanced at me often, but said nothing. Perhaps he could tell that I wanted to make the train slower and slower, always remaining some way below the destination.
