Old acquaintance================



One Christmas, she wrote letters to all the old friends who were listed on her social networks – 583 of them in total. None of them replied, except for a boy she hadn’t known well – they had sat together at primary school, elbowing each other sometimes, and she remembered poking his arm with a pencil. He seemed to interpret her letters as a declaration of love in disguise, and in his reply he was careful to mention his wife and his baby son. She filed the letter, feeling a sense of liberation at all the old ties which had been cut.
