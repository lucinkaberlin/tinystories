I hadnâ€™t forgotten the sharp look in her eye as she tasted a sweet morsel, frowning as if she were eating bitter herbs. She had looked at me like that when we were at school together, and I brought in a homemade treacle tart for her, hoping to win her favour. She only took one bite before she declared it sickly.
