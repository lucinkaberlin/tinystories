After school
============


We were best friends, coauthoring spy stories and marching arm in arm round Richmond Park, but when I moved school, we slowly lost touch. I dreamt about her, even sixty years later, which was odd, because of course Geraldine didn’t age, and went on looking at me mockingly and waving the lacrosse stick which I had never really learned how to use. I was old, in the dreams, seventy-one, seventy-two, and my wrinkled arm tucked through Geraldine’s bare eleven-year-old elbow looked terrifying to me, but Geraldine sang out, frightening the deer, and we walked in step, as always.
