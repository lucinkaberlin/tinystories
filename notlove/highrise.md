High rise horror
================
We lived in the new part of town, built since 1990, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t haunted. The woman in white wore a dirty tracksuit and called the name of a child who never answered, and hundreds of eyes watched us from the walls of the lift, drawn in felt tip pen. Sometimes we escaped to the old town, to seek respite among the medieval ghouls.
