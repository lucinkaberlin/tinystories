So much to tell==============



I dreamt about you. I asked you how you were, and you said, “long story.” I said, “to cut a long story short, we haven’t spoken in ten years, and now you’re in my dream, and you’re still not going to tell me the story, you’re just going to look at me with eyes that imply that it’s the longest story ever written, the most exciting ever heard.” You looked hurt. “I was going to tell you,” you said, and you got up and walked away, your hair turning grey as you walked.
