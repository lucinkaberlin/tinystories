The buddy zone==============



They knew each other for many peaceful years: she smiled at him when they met at the bus stop, he lent her his capo at open mic nights, and they chatted if they ended up side by side in the queue at the bakery. She bought raisin rolls, he bought ryebread. Then, after seven years, he offered to buy her a coffee, adding, “I may be a nice guy, but you can’t keep me in the friend zone forever.” She sighed. “If only you’d worded that differently,” she said, took her raisin rolls and left. “I think that was the acquaintance zone, buddy,” said the baker. “I’m not your damn buddy, man,” he replied, though he and the baker had shared many a pint and a heart to heart over the years.
