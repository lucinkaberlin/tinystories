Christmas fête==============



When I saw her again, her arms looked very thin and she smiled in a half-hearted way. I knew she wouldn’t confide in me, but I gave her a bottle of rose hip wine and told her to keep in touch. Ten years or so later, she sent me a typed letter, in her typical, distant style; she wanted to let me know that she had kept the bottle of wine as a reminder that someone cared about her. Now she was engaged, and she and her fiancé had drunk a couple of glasses to celebrate. They both had awful headaches, she said, but she wanted to thank me. She even invited me to the wedding, but I didn’t go; I realised that I’d be looking at her all the time, trying to find out whether she really was happy.
