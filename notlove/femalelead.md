Female lead===========



The closest she came to success was a meeting with a well-known film director. She had written a script about a middle-aged woman who begins to question her identity, reminisces soulfully about her first love, wanders thoughtfully through beautiful streets, grows distant from her husband and strikes up an exciting friendship with a man half her age. The film director liked it, but said he wanted a man to play the lead, switching the genders. She refused. Years later, she found herself walking through the streets of Venice, wondering if she had made the right decision. Wouldn’t it still have been the same film? Then a young man caught up with her, holding a glove she had dropped. No, it wouldn’t have been the same, she thought.
