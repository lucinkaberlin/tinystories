Hiding underneath
=================
I always blamed myself for Marcy’s death because I used to run away from her when we were kids – I left her at the top of the apple tree and didn’t help her down, and I left her in the freezing water under the falls at Snake Hill, and I left her hiding under the bed when I was supposed to ‘find’ her in a game of hide and seek, when she was still so small she didn’t understand time. It must have seemed like hours to her. But Marcy died in New York, twenty years later, when we’d reached the stage of polite emails and occasional awkward phone calls. No one understood that her death began when I listened to her soft, excited breathing under the bed, as she got ready to laugh and burst out when I called her, and instead I tiptoed out of the room and left her in silence, and dust.
