For seven years, she tried to scrape the French accent off her vowels and shape her consonants into blunt-edged copies of an English voice. When she was tired, or sad, the old sounds came back, and she heard her former self, a girl with long hair, a girl from the mountains who dreamt in flowing French. She bit her tongue and asked her friends to correct her whenever they saw her mouth slip, her lips shape foreign sentences in English, but they didnâ€™t correct her enough, because they loved to hear the echoes of her old life, and see all the shapes of her overlapping selves.
