Reminiscing about John’s childhood, on the day of his wedding=============================================================



Some kids have an invisible friend. John had an invisible enemy. Eating breakfast, his head would snap round as if he’d heard someone come through the door, and I’d see him sneer, then look away. Later, he’d stomp around the yard, kicking the air, destroying somebody’s sandcastles. He grew out of it, of course, but later, when he was angry, I’d notice him stiffen and look out of the window, and I’d almost see the long-lost enemy walking by.
