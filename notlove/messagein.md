Message in a bottle
===================


He had survived a shipwreck. He didnâ€™t like to talk about it. But one day I found him at a flea market, standing at a stall which was piled high with old compasses, prints of famous warships, and even plaques giving thanks for salvation, which must have been taken from a Catholic church. He was holding a little bottle in his hand; inside it was a tiny replica of the Lusitania, complete with black smoke coming from each chimney, which must have been made from some kind of wool. He was looking at it with a kind of faraway delight, as if he would give anything to be standing on its deck, gazing across the ocean towards Liverpool.
