I caught the train each weekend to see her, caught a few odd words of a phone conversation, caught her in bed with somebody whose name I didnâ€™t catch. I caught myself thinking of her now and then, for years afterwards, feeling the same murderous rage each time and daydreaming about whether I would have been caught.
