Life with a kleptomaniac
========================Some weeks, she only stole a couple of chocolate bars and a miniature bottle of whisky; others, she came home with a fur coat, a gold watch or somebody’s chihuahua. I always helped her, because I didn’t want her to go to prison. Then, one day, I came home to find the house full: she had stolen three of her friends’ boyfriends, along with a crate of wine and a ball dress, and they were having a party. I took her car keys and drove off down the highway, realising as I did so that it was too late: she had already stolen my soul, and I’d be back tomorrow, ready with another alibi.
