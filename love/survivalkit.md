Survival kit
============

When she read that cosmonauts used to carry machetes in their emergency kits, she wondered if she was sufficiently prepared for all eventualities. She bought tins of food in case of an apocalypse and watched a video tutorial which showed her how to open them without a tin-opener, just in case. Then she fell in love with Ella, a tightrope-walker and occasional pastry chef, and forgot about the apocalypse entirely.
