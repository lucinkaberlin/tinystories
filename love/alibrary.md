A library of lost things
========================The piles of books had grown till only a narrow path led in between them. Whether she needed the dictionary or the compendium of Japanese seafaring stories, she would run around the labyrinth of books, and slip out a volume without disturbing anything. Later, dismantling her domain, we found all sorts of things pushed in between the books, including photos from the time when the house had visible walls and furniture, as well as some Japanese prints, rolled up, and a letter proposing marriage.
