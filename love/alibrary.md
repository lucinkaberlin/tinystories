A library of lost things
========================The piles of books had grown till only a narrow path led in between them. Whether she needed the dictionary or the compendium of Japanese seafaring stories, she would run around the labyrinth of books, and slip out a volume without disturbing anything. She knew where everything was, so it was strange that she claimed to lose things in the piles: later, dismantling her domain, we found all sorts of things pushed in between the books, including much unopened mail from electricity companies, but also a lot of photos from the time when the house had visible walls and furniture as well as some Japanese prints, rolled up, and a letter proposing marriage.
