For years, they wrote each other letters. He usually left one on the kitchen table when he went to work, and she pinned an envelope to the board above his desk before he came home. He nodded to her and gave her a kiss on the cheek, before settling down with the newspaper, and usually got on to reading her letter before dinner, which they ate whilst listening to the radio. They didn’t talk to each other, except in company, or in an emergency – and when they did, their own voices sounded loud and cracked in their ears, insincere. He wrote to her each evening, sitting across from her on the sofa, while she did the crossword, and there was nothing she liked better than to sit down at the kitchen table the next morning and slit open the envelope, unfold the sheets of thick, cream-coloured paper, covered in his thoughts and questions, ending, always, in a declaration of love.
