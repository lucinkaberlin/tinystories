You and your less beautiful friend
Eavesdropping in a café, I heard you tell a friend how you got drunk and banged your head, wandered into your new boyfriend’s room with blood on your forehead, and laughed when he asked whether you’d fallen off your bike. Your friend’s reaction was strange; I had the feeling she was envious, wanting to sport a scar of her own and wander, bleeding, through the streets, wanting a solicitous boyfriend and a careless, coolly beautiful face like yours. I remembered being a teenager, and tried to recall how long it was before I stopped wanting to be somebody else.
