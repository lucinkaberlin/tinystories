Compelling

It was the sort of book you ‘couldn’t put down’ – and she really couldn’t. She dreamt of the characters – the murderer, the clever child, the confused professor – and shouted out their names in her sleep. She spoke only of them, mentioned them in the document she composed at work, and at last, she looked at me and called me by the name of one of the minor figures, a friend of the professor. She didn’t correct herself and she didn’t seem surprised when I packed my bags: she’d been expecting that guy to vanish from the story anyway.
