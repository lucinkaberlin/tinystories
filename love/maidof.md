Maid of Honour==============


Nervous about the speech, I tried to brainstorm, writing down everything that occurred to me about Jane and Sarah: how Jane looked at me when we first met, how we tried to teach ourselves to make hats, how Jane lay on the floor with her legs on the sofa, talking about Sarah, how Sarah looked pale and dowdy when she arrived at our flat for dinner, and I thought I was going to like her, but the dowdiness was misleading, she had a voice that could make your sentences wither and drop to the ground before you’d even said them, and she wasn’t pale, she was an alabaster goddess, and I was just realising that I loved Sarah, loved her in an awful, unshakeable way, when they announced their engagement.
