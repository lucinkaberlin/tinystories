Looking back
============I wish I’d thrown away that box of his old childhood paintings and exercise books. When he retired, he began looking through them, pointing at the clumsy drawings of his mother or a tractor and exclaiming that he could have been Picasso – or poring over his sums, ticked by the teacher, and demanding why he’d never become a mathematician. I feel it’s only a matter of time before he looks at me and asks, ‘Why didn’t I marry Lisa instead of you?’ She’s the one painted on A2 sugar paper, with twelve fingers sprouting proudly from her stick arms, and a green crown on her head.
