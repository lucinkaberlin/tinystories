Missing each other
==================
There were two different Long Streets in that city, and I went to the wrong one. I waited for hours outside a tall blue house with frilled windows, whilst you sat on the porch of your overgrown place in the suburbs, a glass of lemonade growing warm beside you. It was twenty years before we managed to meet.
