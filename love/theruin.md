The ruin========



When he first bought the house, it was exhausting just listening to him: the pointing, the painting, the grouting, the guttering, the terra cotta tiles and the custom-made doors. Four years later, the place still echoed with cold, and the walls dropped dust on your shoulders. When you moved in, you set up a makeshift kitchen and bought a bed, and it suddenly seemed different. Only sometimes, you dreamt that the roof had fallen in, and you could see the stars. Waking up, youâ€™d find him burrowed down into the bedclothes, one arm around you, dreaming of renovation.
