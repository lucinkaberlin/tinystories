To herself
==========
When I’m away, she revels in it: she wanders the flat naked, cooks strange grains and herbal sauces, sings spontaneous songs with many verses – she tells me all about it. There’s no secret, I know, but when I come back, everything feels different, even my own skin. I ask her to sing me one of those songs, but she doesn’t, of course.
