Who could weep over a strain of music?
======================================



We visited Jack London’s house, where he had a plot of eucalyptus trees and vineyards, white painted walls – no one was there, of course, and all we could do was peer through the windows. He had a lot of plans, which often failed. Later, I read that he wished for a wonderful soul-mate, a man he could merge with, and I thought maybe all that rushing around and the wolf stories and prison and eucalyptus trees were meant to distract him from the absence of the friend, the friend whose shape was always somewhere in the shadows up on the hill above the house, or round the corner among the manzanitas.
