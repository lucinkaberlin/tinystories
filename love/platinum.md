She stopped listening to music when she realised it could read her thoughts and steal the words from her mouth. When she was trying to tell Michal gently that she didn’t want to be with him anymore, a jaunty song began to play on the radio with the words, Every day I love you less and less. This was in Bratislava, and she looked hopefully at Michal, thinking that he might not understand the lyrics, but he did, and he looked at her with a sad frown and also a hint of disgust, as if the radio were telling him that she had been dishonest, which was true, and that she didn’t love him, which was true, and that she didn’t care about his feelings, which was not. She switched off the radio, but from then on, the worry never left her, in cafes and bars: that a song might speak for her, betraying her feelings and painting her in an ugly colour.
